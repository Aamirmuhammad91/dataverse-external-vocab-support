## Dataverse External Vocabulary Management

Dataverse supports the use of third-party vocabulary services through a generic external vocabulary support mechanism, service-specific scripts, and a custom json configuration setting that allows specification of how fields in Dataverse metadatablocks are to be associated with specific services and vocabularies.

This repository contains several usable scripts and example materials that demonstrate how to configure Dataverse to leverage them.
